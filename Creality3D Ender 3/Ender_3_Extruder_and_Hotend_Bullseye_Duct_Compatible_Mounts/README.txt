# Summary

I wanted a way to run a chain from the extruder to the hotend that would work with dpetsel's Bullseye duct. I started with sandpit's Cable Chain Extruder Mount and modified it to give the extruder lever arm more room to move. I narrowed and replaced the mounting point he used with one of johnniewhiskey's chain links so that the fitment is now perfect. Then I added an additional chain mounting point courtesy of hanananana's modified extruder mount. Finally, I adjusted hanananana's modified hotend mount so that it will work with the Bullseye duct. I also made sure that the chain will be level on both ends.

Update
----------

 • 2019.03.18: After seeing two people post that he had issues with the length of the mount being too short for their particular setup, I have added two longer versions.

Versions
------------

 • The normal length should work for most people. The z axis screw lined up perfectly on my Ender 3.

 • If the normal version doesn't line up for you, I have added a +1.5mm and +3.0mm length version you can use instead.


Printing Notes
-------------------

 • If your printer setup and filament can do good bridges, you can print with with supports touching build plate only, otherwise you will need to set supports to touch everywhere.

 • Turn off Support Interface settings if you are using them and instead bump the Support Density setting to 25. This will give good support and leave the underside looking fairly good while keeping it easy to remove.

 • Be careful when removing the supports from the chain mount on the extruder piece that goes to the hotend or it may break. I did make it a little thicker so that it will be less likely to split. Printing a little hotter will help.

Installation Notes
-----------------------

 • You may find it easier to attach the hotend cable to the mount with the clips prior to bolting on the mount.

• You need a minimum of 5 chain links from the extruder to the hotend mount.
