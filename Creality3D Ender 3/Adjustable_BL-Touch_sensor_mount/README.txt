Adjustable BL-Touch sensor mount for Ender 3 and CR10 (with STEP file) by registeredthing is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution - Non-Commercial license.

# Summary

This is an adjustable (up and down) mount for BL-touch, and BL-touch type sensors.  It is designed for the Ender3 (and therefore also the CR-10 and other Creality printers that use the same hot end design).

This thing is a mash up of the rails used in Chito's "CR-10 Heavy Duty customisable modular e3D V6 mount Volcano 5015 ABL", and the mount used in Lucid's "CR-10 BLtouch mount", and is designed to be adjustable.  

-------------------------------------

Since this was originally posted, there have been a few updates (newest first):

<strong>4-25-2019:</strong>  Thanks to <a><href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3586322">Eric_Csuf's improved remix of the 4-40 version</a> (and his permission), the mount posted here has been updated with pockets which help the base of the mount sit flush to the hot end carriage that it mounts to.  <strong>The updated mount is named:</strong>

<strong> "adj-bltouch-mount-3D-mount-EC-mod.stl" </strong>

<strong><strong>If you use the new version of the mount part (above), please print it with supports, since it has pockets on the side that faces the carriage.</strong></strong>

I will leave the original version of the mount (adj-bltouch-mount-3D-mount-RTP.stl), without the pockets, here as well.

<strong>10-27-2018:</strong>  Minor update to the wing design.  I will leave the original version (3D) available, since it appears to be working, but have also uploaded a new "4A" wing design.  The differences between the "3D" and "4A" design are:

* adjustment slot extends 2mm lower, since it appears that most people are setting the mount near the lowest 	point of the adjustment range.

* decreased the overall height which may help with printing quicker and saving some material.

-------------------------------------

This mount will need a 10mm M3 screw and a M3 nut in addition to the mounting hardware for the touch probe.

STEP files is included for easy remixing.

Thanks to Demonhawk for these updated offsets:

define X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER -44
define Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER -14

If you have different hardware on hand (other than M3), check the remixes out.  If you don't have any M3 nut handy, torsoreaper posted a remix that does not need it (just requires the M3 screw).
