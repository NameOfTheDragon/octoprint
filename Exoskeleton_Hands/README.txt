3D printed exoskeleton hands that I made for a bit of fun. If you want to watch a video of it in use https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7T-S3UFR-0. For the latest 3D printed exoskeleton updates visit https://sellfy.com/3DPrintIt. My website is http://3dprintit.com.au/.  

DESCRIPTION  

PLEASE READ THE MANUAL BEFORE PRINTING  

The manual is in the .zip file. I designed the hand using ABS plastic the more infill the stronger the hand but the longer the print time. The entire hand will take approximately 18 hours in total and cost about $8.00 in plastic (at 4 cents a gram). All parts were printed on my Up Plus 2 with 14cm x 15cm x 15cm build volume. There are also a lot of metal screws that you need to hold all of the printed parts together. I used sheet metal self tapper pan screws 8G x 9mm.
