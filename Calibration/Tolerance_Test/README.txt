# Summary

***Update 4/18/19*** The tolerances on the curved surfaces of the pegs are tighter than what they should be due to the modeling method I used. I need to go back and adjust this.

I wanted to see how tight of a tolerance my new Prusa i3 mk3 can hold. I wanted a tolerance test with levers on it to move the test pegs, like the one from Maker's Muse, but I didn't feel like paying for it. If the handles are not enough to break the pegs free, there are holes for a 4mm hex key in each peg. I made these somewhat tight, as the other tolerance test I've tried had the hex key fit pretty loose and I was unable to break free at least one peg that probably would have worked had the hex key fit tighter. I also added chamfers on the bottom to prevent sticking due to layer squish. This part is intended to be printed with the tolerance size numbers facing up. It may come into your slicer upside down due to the way I modeled it.
